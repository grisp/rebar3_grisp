## [Unreleased]

## [2.3.0] - 2022-06-07

### Added

- Exact OTP version selection, e.g. '=23.3'
- Toolchain validation before building

### Changed

- The OTP Git repository is more thoroughly checked for consistency

### Fixed

- Deploy and build tasks now works offline
- Extracted packages are cached globally instead of per project
- Custom builds now correctly uses OTP versions from Git
- `rebar3 package list` now sorts versions correctly

## [2.2.2] - 2022-03-01

### Fixed

- Fix processing of already downloaded OTP packages (through grisp_tools)

## [2.2.1] - 2022-03-01

### Added

- Automatically pick the highest version when only the release name is
  specified during deployment (#64)
- `rebar3 grisp package list` can now list both OTP and toolchain packages. In
  addition, it can display only certain columns.
- OTP Git cloning is now shallow (using `--dethp 1`) which more than halves the
  download time of OTP sources.

### Fixed

- Deploys no longer crash on invalid release names or versions (#68)

## [2.2.0] - 2022-02-16

### Added

- `rebar3 grisp package list` can now take a `--hash` flag that prints all hash versions of a package

### Changed

- Deploying without a custom OTP build will correctly pick a version from
  existing pre-built packages or show a proper error

## [2.1.0] - 2022-02-14

### Added

- `rebar3 grisp package list` task that lists pre-built OTP package versions

### Changed

- `deploy` task no longer requires specifying release name and version if there
  is only one release

### Fixed

- Template rendering no longer crashes when environment variables contain
  unicode (#42)

## [2.0.0] - 2022-02-01

**BREAKING CHANGE:** Require `GRISP_TC_ROOT` for all Erlang version to point
to the tool chain root folder and not the subfolder `rtems/5`. If you have
configured the setting `grisp.build.toolchain.directory` you need to remove
the `rtems/5` postfix if present.
